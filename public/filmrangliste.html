<h3>Queen of the Desert</h3>
<p>An adventurous woman who dedicates herself to exploring the Bedouins and traveling with them through the deserts.</p>

<h3>Hidden Figures</h3>
<p>They were women in a man's world. The film shows the segregation and prejudice they encountered. It also shows a world just before computers came in, with space trajectories figured out in pencil. Totally amazing.</p>

<h3>Begin again</h3>
<p>Two unknowns who have dedicated themselves to music and are starting from scratch.</p>
